ECTE351 Group 8 Project:
Shared with Tom, Jonathan and Joy

Published publically for marking purposes by ECTE315 staff

The goal of this project is to design and manufacture a quality evaluation system that utilises computer vision and machine learning. The selected CV model will be Yolo v8 due to it's lightweight and exceptional object detection. We will retrain the model using out own data for our own use case. 

The outcome for this project is the hopes the camera will be able to reliably detect defective screws, which will be sent past on a conveyor belt built by our team. The interactive sections of this project also include a GUI operating on a touch screen, that allows for a variaty of settings to be adjusted as per the use case. 

We are hoping to present this at the 2025 trade show at UOW.
